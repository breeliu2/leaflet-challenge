# Instructions
This module employs leaflet, JavaScript, and D3 to display the earthquake information obtained from the Unites States Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS assumes responsibility for furnishing scientific dta pertaining to natural calamities, the well-being of our ecosystems and environment, and the repercussions of climate and land-use alterations. Their scientists devise novel techniques and tools to promptly deliver pertinent and valuable insights concerning the Earth and it processes. 

## Level 1: Fundamental Visualization
Obtain the Dataset
* The USGS supplies earthquake data in various formats, updated at five-minute intervals.
* The dataset titled "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" was selected from the USGS GeoJSON Feed webpage.
* The data was availabe in JSON format, which was utilized to retrieve the data for visualization.

Import and Visualize the Data
* Construct a map using Leaflet to plot all earthquakes from the dataset, based on longitude and latitude.
* The size of the data markers corresponds to the magnitude of each earthquake, while the color indicates the depth of the earthquake.
* Larger markers represent earthquakes with higher magnitudes, and darker colors signify greater depths.
* When a marker is clicked, popups are displayed, providing additional information about the earthquake.
* To provide context for the map data, a legend was generated.
